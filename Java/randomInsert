//function: Random Insert
	//description: This function is called after the user moves. It adds a piece to the board using a random row and column. 
	//				before adding, it checks to ensure that where the piece is added is empty. 
	//parameters: Board - a 2D array that represents the 4x4 grid 
	//return: board - the 2D array with the added piece
	public static PracticeBlock[][]  randomInsert(PracticeBlock[][] board) {

		//boolean value to figure out when a piece has been added
		boolean added = false;

		//while loop - loops through finding random location until location is empty
		while(!added) {

			//Integer values that represent the row and column for the added piece. They are found by using Math.random
			int r = (int)(Math.random()*4);
			int c = (int)(Math.random()*4); 

			//This if an if statement that checks if the generated location in empty (equal to 0). It also creates another math.random
			//which is used to determine if a 4 or a 2 is added (2 occurs 90%, 4 occurs 10%). If the location is empty, and therefore,
			//piece is added, the boolean added is now true - this stops the loops since a block has been added 
			if(board[r][c] == null && Math.random() >= 0.9) {
				
				//FIX
				board[r][c] = new PracticeBlock(c*100, r*100, 4, 1);
				added = true;
			}
			else if (board[r][c] == null){
				
				//FIX
				board[r][c] = new PracticeBlock(c*100, r*100, 2, 1);
				added = true;
			}
		}
		
		//this returns the board variable (the given board) with the new piece added
